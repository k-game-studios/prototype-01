# 2D Game with Vite + Phaser

This is a scalable and modular architecture for a 2D game using **Vite** and **Phaser**. The project is structured to ensure easy expansion, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

### 3. Folder Breakdown

### `assets/`
Contains all non-code files such as images, sounds, fonts, and other static assets used in the game.

### `config/`
Stores global game settings, such as screen size, physics settings, constants, etc.

### `core/`
This folder contains the main game code, divided into different subfolders:
- **`scenes/`**: Contains the different scenes of the game (e.g., `MenuScene.ts`, `GameScene.ts`).
- **`entities/`**: Defines game entities such as players, enemies, NPCs, items, etc.
- **`ui/`**: Contains UI components like HUD, menus, and buttons.
- **`systems/`**: Houses various game systems, such as combat, physics, and custom mechanics.

### `utils/`
Holds utility functions like math helpers, ID generators, etc., that are used throughout the game.

### `state/`
Contains the state management logic, which could be custom or use libraries like **Redux** or **Zustand**. It stores the game state (e.g., player progress, scores, etc.).

### `services/`
Responsible for handling communication with external services, such as APIs or WebSocket for multiplayer or online features.

### `main.ts`
This file is the entry point for the game. It initializes the game.

### `game.ts`
Sets up the **Phaser** game instance and initializes the scenes.

### `index.html`
The base HTML file that loads the game.
